You should create a Vue.js application with two pages.
- First should be on url '/'
- On load this page should show 10 fields marked as A, B, C, D .... with value 3.
- After page load every 2 seconds all field values should be changed randomly. Change is randomly calculated as a number between 1 and 2, with a random sign (-, +).
- When adding the change to the previous value you should show an arrow pointing up or down, depending on the change sign (arrow down is for -, arrow up is for +).
- Under each field there should be a toggle button to disable/enable the change on that field.
- Second should be on url '/statistics'
- This page should show change statistics for all 10 fields.
- Chart should show value changes in time.
- When going from '/' to '/statistics' all the changing should be paused, and on returning back it should be resumed.
- You can choose any libraries you want
